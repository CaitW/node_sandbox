For example, were all of the amphibians in the study area recorded, or does the inventory only reflect half of the amphibians present? Completeness can be inferred from survey effort and methods and can be assessed using the length and timing of the study, spatial extent of sampling, inclusion of all habitats present in study area, expertise of individuals conducting the inventory, and/or species accumulation curves."
"inventory","inv_completeness_lower","Lower Bound","tooltip","Inferred completeness is captured in quartiles (i.e., 0, 25, 50, 75). Indicate the lower bound of completeness percentage for the study. For example, if you believe the inventory represents 25-50% of the species present in the area, indicate a value of 25 for the lower bound."

"inventory","inv_completeness_rationale","Rationale used to determine completeness","tooltip","Provide an explanation for your completeness score. Examples of high completeness: the surveyors used several different survey methods to inventory the target taxonomic group (i.e., Ungulates); the surveyors made great effort to survey each habitat type in the study area that a species from the target group would be found in; the authors utilized several resources such as museum specimens and primary literature to produce a complete inventory. Examples of low completeness: the study length was not appropriate for the size of the area; inappropriate or insufficient methods were used for the target group; the study area was difficult to traverse/hard to access."

            <br /> <b>Restricted Search</b> - Highly structured survey methods such as transects or plots.
            <br /> <b>Open Search</b> - Less restrictive than restricted search. A particular search area is defined, but effort is presumed to be standardized across those areas; for example, """"We searched sites for a specific length of time proportional to the area.""""
            <br /> <b>Opportunistic Search</b> - A search such as that often performed in efforts such as eBird where a surveyor goes to an area and makes observations in an area that doesn't have a pre-defined shape and size, nor necessarily a clear effort measurement associated with it.
            <br /> <b>Trap</b> - Stationary traps, camera traps, or nets were used.
            <br /> <b>Adventitious</b> - Any survey data obtained from sources besides live sightings, such as scat, roadkill, specimens presented by hunters, or animals sold at markets.
            <br /> <b>Incidental</b> - A casual search that happens with minimal effort such as reports of species observed while eating lunch or otherwise not actively looking. This may also refer to organisms which are outside the scope of the survey but which the authors specifically noted.""
